This is a new set of notes because the CPUIO protocol is not relevant enough to Super Mario World for me to properly record a changelog... and there's plenty more hardcoded stuff here.

Usage is separated by CPUIO register.

CPUIO0 ($2140/$F4)
-------------------
Polling rate: Once per music tempo tick.

Output: Current music ID playing. Zeroed out once the music is done playing.

Input:
%xyzaaaaa
- %x disables BRR wind noise playback on channel 8. This is forced on music IDs $02, $0D and $11 if %x, %y and %z are all zero.
- %y, with %x cleared, enables a higher-frequency BRR wind noise. This takes precedence over setting %z.
- %z, with %x cleared, enables a lower-frequency BRR wind noise.
- %aaaaa is the music ID. If zero, then the music will keep playing normally.

CPUIO1 ($2141/$F5)
-------------------
Polling rate: Once per SFX tempo tick.

Output: Current SFX playing on voice 2.

Input:
$00 - NOP
Does absolutely nothing.

$FF - Stop Sound + Load New Data
Stops the sound, then jumps to a modified copy of the IPL Boot ROM. The biggest difference is that unlike a standard IPL Boot ROM, this one doesn't have a jump anywhere case after you're done loading.

xy - Play SFX Sequence
($01-$FE)
- x is a four-bit/one nibble SFX ID for voice 7.
-- $E mutes all other channels sound upon playing the SFX (including the music, which causes new values to not be acknowledged). Any other ID played afterwards unmutes the music. This also cannot be interrupted by other SFX value entered here except for $F.
-- $1 cannot be interrupted by other SFX in this same area except for $E and $F.
-- $5 plays nothing, although it still works for unmuting music and other channels.
- y is a four-bit/one nibble SFX ID for voice 2.
-- Some SFX are not interruptible. In order of uninterruptibility priority with other SFX IDs, we have $A, $7 ($5 is allowed to overwrite $7 in this instance), then $9.
-- $F plays nothing.

CPUIO2 ($2142/$F6)
-------------------
Polling rate: Once per SFX tempo tick.

Output: Current engine control value. Zeroed out when the highest bit is set.

$00 - NOP
Does absolutely nothing.

%0xyyyyyy - Engine Control
($01-$7F)
Plays an engine noise on voices 4 and 5.
- %x, when starting the aircraft engine, determines what kind of noise it makes. A different command (other than NOP) must be used before changing the engine noise.

%10xxxxxx - Break
($80-$BF)
Plays a break noise on voice 5.
- %xxxxxx only does something different when set to $01, which is a slight pitch variant. All other cases are identical to $00.

%11?????? - Skid
($C0-$FE)
Causes randomly generated BRR wind noise frequency notes to be generated for voice 5.

$FF - Stop Engine
Basically acts as a reset for the aircraft engine back to default settings, in addition to stopping it. 

CPUIO3 ($2143/$F7)
-------------------
Polling rate: Once per SFX tempo tick.

Output: Current SFX ID playing on voice 3. Zeroed out once the SFX is done playing.

$00, $03-$FF - NOP

$01 - Engine-Controlled SFX
Plays a fixed sequence of notes on voice 3 at a variable note length controlled by the engine frequency that goes faster the higher the frequency. Only works with a CPUIO2 value of $02-$11: otherwise, it's a NOP. 

$02 - Beep
Plays a single note on voice 3. No other conditions are required here.
