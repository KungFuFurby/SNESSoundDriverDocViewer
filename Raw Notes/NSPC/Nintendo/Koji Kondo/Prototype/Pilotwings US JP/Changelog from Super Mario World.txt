(CPUIO Protocol)
- Play Music was moved from CPUIO2 ($2142/$F6) to CPUIO0 ($2140/$F4), and now occupies the lowest five bits unconditionally, instead of being used when the highest bit is zero and the ID taking up seven bits.
- SFX Sequence Set 1 was effectively moved from CPUIO0 ($2140/$F4) to the low nibble of CPUIO1 ($2141/$F5).
- SFX Sequence Set 1 was effectively moved from CPUIO3 ($2143/$F7) to the high nibble of CPUIO1 ($2141/$F5).
