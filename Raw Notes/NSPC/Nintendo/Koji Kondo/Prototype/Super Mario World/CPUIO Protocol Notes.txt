Usage is separated by CPUIO register.

CPUIO0 ($2140/$F4)

Output: Current SFX ID playing on voice 4. Zeroed out once the SFX is done playing.

Input:
$00 - NOP
Does absolutely nothing. 

%0xxxxxxx - Play SFX Sequence Set 1
($01-$7F)
- %xxxxxxx is the SFX ID to play.
- $11 mutes the amplifiers and pauses the music once it finishes playing.
-- Any SFX from SFX Sequence Set 1 will unpause the music and unmute the amplifiers.
-- Any noise SFX from SFX Sequence Set 2 will unmute the amplifiers, but not unpause the music.
- $11 and $1D do not permit the Hurry Up! SFX command to be played until it is finished. They also cannot be interrupted, except by $11 or $12.

%1??????? - Hurry Up!
($80-$FF)
- Plays SFX ID $1D on both SFX sequence sets and offsets the tempo by $0A without overflow checks. This can stack if it is played multiple times, but only the first one will remain in effect until forced off.

CPUIO1 ($2141/$F5)
-------------------
Output: Current SFX ID playing on voice 7. Zeroed out once the SFX is done playing.

Input:

Does absolutely nothing.

$01 - Jump
Plays Mario's jumping SFX on voice 7. This is a one note hardcoded ASM SFX with a pitch bend.

$02 - Enable Yoshi Drums
Enables Yoshi Drums on voice 5. This simply means that the voice is unmuted.
Yoshi Drums are only supported on music IDs $01-$03 and $06. If this is true, voice 5 is set to SFX instrument ID $09.

$03 - Disable Yoshi Drums
Disables Yoshi Drums.

$04 - Girder
Plays a girder SFX on voice 7. This is a two note hardcoded ASM SFX.

$FF - Stop Sound + Load New Data
