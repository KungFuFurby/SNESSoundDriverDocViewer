This is a versioning history of NSPC/Koji Kondo by build.

(Prototype)
0.0a - Super Mario World
0.0b - Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World (Super Mario World build
0.1a - Pilotwings (US & Japanese versions)
0.1b - Pilotwings (European version)

All Prototype build pre-date the standard Kankichi-kun build version-wise. Beyond this point use standard Kankichi-kun.

Versioning history is a little weird here... this is because the protocol is constantly changing for a start.

Super Donkey 1 is mid-transition between SimCity and Legend of Zelda: it has SimCity leftovers, but has the protocol of Legend of Zelda.

Super Mario All-Stars is a weird case versioning-wise. The music player puts it past Star Glider, but before Star Fox. However, its ARAM map and protocol are evolved from Super Mario World's, with a little bit of Pilotwings for the BRR wind noise. Plus, the SFX code is also based off of Super Mario World's due to fixed channel allocation, and the protocol is a modified form of what was used in Super Mario World.
Thus, Super Mario All-Stars is considered music player 3.0, but everything else 0.2.

Star Glider, consequently, gets a 2.5 for the music player and SFX code, but a 3.0 for protocol (it carries over to Star Fox/Star Wing), and Star Fox/Star Wing gets a 3.1.

Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island Prototype appears to be mid-transition between Star Fox/Star Wing and the final version.

And then there's Star Fox 2's builds. I consider these to branch off of Star Fox. They also have a different programmer, Yoji Inagaki.
