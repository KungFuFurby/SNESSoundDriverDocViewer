These sets of notes are also new, because they're not really relevant to either Super Mario World or Pilotwings.

Usage is separated by CPUIO register.

CPUIO0 ($2140/$F4)
-------------------
Polling rate: Once per music tempo tick.

Output: Current music ID playing. Zeroed out once the music is done playing.

Input:
$00 - NOP
Does absolutely nothing.

$01-$EF, $F2-$FF - Play Music
- $01-$06 will run like $F1 if %x is set and %y is cleared.

$F0 - Stop Music

$F1 - Fade Out
Fades out the song volume over 160 tempo ticks.

CPUIO1 ($2141/$F5)
-------------------
Polling rate: Once per music and SFX tempo tick.

Output: Always zero after initialization.

Input: %??????xy
- %x, when set, turns music IDs $01-$06 on. Note that you must manually trigger a piece of music after this: there is no pausing or unpausing of music through this method.
- %y, when set, stops the piece of music currently playing and turns music IDs $01-$06 off. Instead, when setting the music ID to these IDs, the previous piece of music will fade out (like $F1). This has priority over turning the music on.

CPUIO2 ($2142/$F6)
-------------------
Polling rate: Once per SFX tempo tick.

Output: Always zero after initialization.

Input:
$00 - NOP

xx - Play SFX Sequence Set 1
($01-$FF)
- xx is a SFX ID to play on a dynamically allocated voice. These can trigger other SFX IDs, and more than one of the same SFX instance can run at the same time.

CPUIO3 ($2143/$F7)
-------------------
Polling rate: Once per SFX tempo tick.

Output: Always zero after initialization.

Input:
$00 - NOP

%0xxxxxxx - Play SFX Sequence Set 2
($01-$7F)
- %xxxxxxx is a SFX ID to play on a dynamically allocated voice. These can trigger other SFX IDs. Retriggering the same SFX ID restarts the SFX on the voice it was allocated on.

%1??????? - Stop SFX On Voice That Last Played SFX Sequence Set 2 ID $09
($80-$FF)
Stops a SFX instance that last played on the voice that triggered SFX Sequence 2 ID $09.
