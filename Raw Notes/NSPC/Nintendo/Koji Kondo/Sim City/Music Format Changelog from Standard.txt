This is the first version to be used from N-SPC/Nintendo/Koji Kondo that uses standard Kankichi-kun as opposed to a prototype version. Tracing, thus, is done from standard Kankichi-kun instead of Pilotwings.

(Music Format)
- Command IDs $FB-$FE are cut. However, the fast forward phrase commands are still present.
- Command $E5 (Song Volume) is not permitted to run if the song volume is being faded from a CPUIO command.
