(CPUIO0 ($2140/$F4) Protocol)
- $01-$06 are no longer disabled by a switch. This is mostly because CPUIO1's purpose was completely replaced: there is still leftover code.

(CPUIO1 ($2141/$F5) Protocol)
- Completely replaced, so it is defined below...

Polling rate: Once per SFX tempo tick.

Output: Always zero after initialization.

Input:
$00 - NOP

xx - Play SFX Sequence Set 1
($01-$FF)
- xx is a SFX ID to play on voice 7. The SFX ID can optionally trigger a second instance on voice 6 if an array entry is non-zero.

NOTE: CPUIO2 and CPUIO3 have a conflict bug if they are triggered first and CPUIO1 tries to overwrite it.

(CPUIO2 ($2142/$F6) Protocol)
- Redefined with some extra bits below...

%xyzzzzzz - Play SFX Sequence Set 2
- %x activates panning on the left. This bit has priority over %y.
- %y activates panning on the right.
- %zzzzzz is a SFX ID. 

(CPUIO3 ($2142/$F6) Protocol)
- Duplicate instances now no longer overwrite each other, instead taking up a different voice.
- Redefined with some extra bits below...

%xyzzzzzz - Play SFX Sequence Set 3
- %x activates panning on the left. This bit has priority over %y.
- %y activates panning on the right.
- %zzzzzz is a SFX ID.
