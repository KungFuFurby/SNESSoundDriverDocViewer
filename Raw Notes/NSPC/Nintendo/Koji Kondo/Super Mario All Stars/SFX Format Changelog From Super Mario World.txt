The SFX format is traced from Super Mario World programmatically due to essentially having the same starting template.

- The command IDs are based off of modern N-SPC. That means these movements...
-- Instrument is moved from VCMD $DA to VCMD $E0.
-- Note Pitch Envelope To is moved from VCMD $EB to VCMD $F1.
-- Note + Pitch Slide To Note is moved from VCMD $DD to VCMD $F9.

- Other changes, sorted by command...
-- In Instrument Setup (Command $DA/$E0)...
--- The pitch base fractional multiplier is explicitly zeroed out when a SFX instrument is set up. This is notable because one didn't exist before.
--- The echo write flag is accounted for when handling noise. Previously there was a bug where echo writes were always being enabled when noise was used due to clearing the flag by mistake.
