This is a versioning history of NSPC/Konami by build.

1.0a - Gradius 3
1.0b - Ganbare Goemon - Yukihime Kyuushutsu Emaki/Legend of the Mystical Ninja
1.1 - Akumajou Dracula (1991-06-13 Prototype)
1.5 - Akumajou Dracula/Super Castlevania IV
2.0 - Parodius Da! - Shinwa kara Owarai e/Parodius: Non-Sense Fantasy
2.? - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Turtles in Time (Beta)
2.? - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Turtles in Time

Akumajou Dracula (1991-06-13 Prototype) is traced from Gradius 3 due to containing leftovers from that build (though at least some of the components are de-facto inaccessible because the command IDs themselves were dummied out).
