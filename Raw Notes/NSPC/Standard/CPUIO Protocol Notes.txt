This is the original CPUIO protocol for Kankichi-kun that many different sound drivers inherit off of.

Usage is technically separated by CPUIO register... though only one is fully defined.

CPUIO0 ($2140/$F4)
-------------------
Polling rate: Once per music tempo tick.

Output: Current music ID playing. Zeroed out once the music is done playing.

Input:
$00 - Stop Music
Initializes an invalid phrase pointer, then stops the previous piece of music. This is not compatible with the resume command, as it is irrevocable, unlike the other one.

$01-$EF, $F2-$FE - Play Music
Stops a previous piece of music, then plays a piece of music by the ID specified in the command.

$F0 - Pause Music
Stops music, allowing it to be resumed later.

$F1 - Continue Music
Resumes a paused song.

$FF - Load New Data
Jumps to a modified copy of the IPL Boot ROM. The biggest difference is that unlike a standard IPL Boot ROM, this one doesn't have a jump anywhere case after you're done loading.
