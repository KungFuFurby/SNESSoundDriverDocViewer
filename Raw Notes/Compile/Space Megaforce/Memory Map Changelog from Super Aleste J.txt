This is a streamlined version of my memory map notes covering changes made from the Japanese version of Super Aleste to Space Megaforce.

Same as Super Aleste (Japanese version) (NOTE: Scratch RAM also counts) (including individual bits if they don't match):
$00
$01 bits 1-2, 4-5
$10-$2C
$34-$3A
$4E-$5D
$60-$63
$80-$9D
$9E-$AC bits 3-6
$AD-$D9
$300-$3C2
$3F0-$5CF

Relocated compared to Super Aleste (Japanese version):
$2E -> $EA
$2F -> $EB
$3B -> $3E
$3C -> $40
$3D -> $42
$3E -> $44
$3F -> $46
$42-$43 -> $3B-$3C
$47 -> $3D
$48-$4B -> $64-$67

$280-$287 -> $200-$207
$290-$297 -> $210-$217
$2A0-$2A7 -> $220-$227
$2B0-$2B7 -> $230-$237
$2C0-$2C7 -> $240-$247
$2D0-$2D7 -> $250-$257
$2E0-$2E7 -> $260-$267
$2F0-$2F7 -> $270-$277

New/Unused memory map locations (including individual bits):
$01 - Bit 3 still has its purpose, though it's only in one place now. However, it can no longer be directly set, and all other echo-related checks are gone anyways.
$02-$0F - Unused. Technically one can write to these memory locations through CPU commands, but they otherwise aren't very notable.
$2D - Unused. Technically one can write to this memory location through CPU commands, but this otherwise isn't very notable.
$2E - Only ever zeroed out. Otherwise, it's unused. Technically one can write to this memory location through CPU commands, but this otherwise isn't very notable.
$2F-$33 - Unused. Technically one can write to these memory locations through CPU commands, but they otherwise aren't very notable.
$3F - Unused. Technically one can write to this memory location through CPU commands, but this otherwise isn't very notable.
$41 - Unused. Technically one can write to this memory location through CPU commands, but this otherwise isn't very notable.
$43 - Unused. Technically one can write to this memory location through CPU commands, but this otherwise isn't very notable.
$45 - Unused. Technically one can write to this memory location through CPU commands, but this otherwise isn't very notable.
$47-$4D - Unused. Technically one can write to these memory locations through CPU commands, but they otherwise aren't very notable.
$5E-$5F - Unused. Technically one can write to these memory locations through CPU commands, but they otherwise aren't very notable.
$68-$7F - Unused. Technically one can write to these memory locations through CPU commands, but they otherwise aren't very notable.
$9E-$AC - Bits 0 and 1 are unused.
$DA-$E9 - Unused. Technically one can write to these memory locations through CPU commands, but they otherwise aren't very notable.
$EC-$EF - Unused. Technically one can write to this memory location through CPU commands, but this otherwise isn't very notable.
$100-$1CF - Reserved for stack.
$1D0-$1FF - Unused.
$208-$20F - Unused.
$218-$21F - Unused.
$228-$22F - Unused.
$238-$23F - Unused.
$248-$24F - Unused.
$258-$25F - Unused.
$268-$26F - Unused.
$278-$2FF - Unused.
$3C3-$3EF - Unused. Technically they can act as additional loop layers (and they fit neatly into the one byte per track formula, since they're in range of the nesting level.
$5D0-$5FF - Unused.
