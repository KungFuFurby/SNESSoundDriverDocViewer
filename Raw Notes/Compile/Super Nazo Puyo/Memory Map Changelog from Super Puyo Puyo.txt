This is a streamlined version of my memory map notes covering changes made from Super Puyo Puyo to Super Nazo Puyo.

Same as Jaki Crush:
$01 bit 3

Same as Super Puyo Puyo (NOTE: Scratch RAM also counts):

Relocated compared to Super Puyo Puyo:

New/Unused memory map locations (including individual bits):
$01 - Bit 6 mutes the amplifiers when set.
$02-$0F - Unused. Technically one can write to these memory locations through CPU commands, but they otherwise aren't very notable.
$2D-$2F - Unused. Technically one can write to these memory locations through CPU commands, but they otherwise aren't very notable.
$44 - Gains an extra bit usage in bit 6, which mutes the amplifiers when set... which kind of moves this away from being a noise clock mirror outright.
$47-$4A - Unused. Technically one can write to these memory locations through CPU commands, but they otherwise aren't very notable.
$60-$61 - Unused. Technically one can write to these memory locations through CPU commands, but they otherwise aren't very notable.
$78-$7F - Unused. Technically one can write to these memory locations through CPU commands, but they otherwise aren't very notable.
$A0-$AF - Bits 0-1 are unused.
$208-$20F - Unused.
$218-$21F - Unused.
$228-$22F - Unused.
$238-$23F - Unused.
$248-$24F - Unused.
$258-$25F - Unused.
$268-$26F - Unused.
$278-$2FF - Unused.
TODO what else...
