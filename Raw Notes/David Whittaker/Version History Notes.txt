This is my versioning history for David Whittaker's sound driver.

Note that due to the way ARAM map tracing works, Kick Off/Super Kick Off was done first because of its 5 channel configuration for music. Krusty's Super Fun House, on the other hand, is technically a slightly earlier code version, but otherwise doesn't have ARAM map-related changes other than relocations.

Also, featuresets may vary between versions.

NOTE: Versioning info is mostly from the SNESLab wiki entry at this time: further analysis will be done sorted by build. However, the featuresets may heavily vary between each other, which in turn can cause ARAM locations to become unused.
