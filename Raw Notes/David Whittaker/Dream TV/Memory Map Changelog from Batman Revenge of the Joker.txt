This is a streamlined version of my memory map notes covering changes made from Batman: Revenge of the Joker to Dream TV.

Same as Batman: Revenge of the Joker (NOTE: Scratch RAM also counts):
$04-$DA
$100-$19F

Relocated compared to Batman: Revenge of the Joker:
N/A

New/Unused memory map locations (including individual bits):
$00-$03 - Unused.
$DB-$EF - Unused.

$1A0-$1FF - Reserved for stack.

Other notes:
$11-$16 - These are only written to, never read from. However, their statuses as de-facto mirrors still apply.
$141,$143,$145,$147,$149,$14B,$14D,$14F - This is still just an RNG flag for SFX, but the behavior is different: now the high byte of the pitch is offsetted by the RNG value ANDed by $3F on a per-step basis.
