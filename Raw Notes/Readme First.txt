Welcome to my raw notes section! These contain my raw notes for each sound driver that I have released the documentation for.

The earliest versions get the full documentation, while later ones are done changelog style with some categorization. They consist of variable ARAM map traces (note that I say variable: most other hardcoded and swappable data pointer cases tend to be unstable from build to build and/or from game to game, so I avoid these cases because my documentation is focused on the code).

See the Version History Notes in each sound driver for some ordering of each one.

These raw notes will be translated to code that will then be used to generate a collection of static pages that will contain the documentation of each sound driver.
