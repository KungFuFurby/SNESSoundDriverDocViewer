# SNES Sound Driver Documentation Viewer

Web page designed for viewing documentation from various SPC700 sound driver builds for the SNES from ARAM maps to communication protocols to internal sound formats.

This repository was created by KungFuFurby in order to consolidate a variety of documentation gathered by various reverse engineers and other contributors into a space that the user can view in one place.
